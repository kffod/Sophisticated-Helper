**LEGALITY DISCLAIMER:** The following information is for educational purposes only.  Any use of this information for unauthorized access or modification of systems is strictly prohibited and may result in severe legal consequences.  Only use with explicit written authorization from the system owner.


**1) Objective:**  This document outlines a procedure for investigating the potential presence of a specific, known malware sample ("OR") on a target system.  This is *not* a general-purpose malware detection solution.


**2) Tools:**

*   A forensic Linux Live CD/USB (e.g., Kali Linux, Autopsy) â€“  Booting from this prevents modification of the potentially compromised system.
*   `strings` (standard Linux utility)
*   `grep` (standard Linux utility)
*   Hashing utility (e.g., `sha256sum`)
*   A known good hash of the "OR" malware sample.


**3) Step-by-Step:**

1. **Boot from Forensic Live CD/USB:**  Insert the Live CD/USB and boot the target system from it.  This ensures a clean environment for analysis.

2. **Mount Target System Drives:** Identify and mount the target system's drives (e.g., `/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sdb1`) using appropriate commands, e.g.,  `sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/target` (replace `/dev/sda1` and `/mnt/target` with the correct device and mount point).

3. **Hash Calculation of Suspected Files:**  If you suspect specific files, calculate their SHA256 hashes. For example: `sha256sum /mnt/target/path/to/suspicious/file`.  Compare the calculated hash against the known good hash of "OR" malware.


4. **String Search:** Use `strings` to extract printable strings from potentially infected files or directories: `strings /mnt/target/path/to/suspicious/file | grep -i "or"` (case-insensitive search for "or").  This is a rudimentary check and will yield many false positives.


5. **Recursive String Search:** For a broader search, use `find` combined with `xargs` and `grep`:  `find /mnt/target -type f -exec grep -i "or" {} +`.  This searches recursively for the string "or" within all files in the mounted target system.  This will generate a massive number of results and requires significant filtering.


**4) Expected Outcome:**

*   A match between a calculated hash and the known "OR" malware hash indicates the presence of the malware.
*   The `strings` and `grep` commands may provide partial matches or indicative strings related to "OR" if present.  Note:  These are highly unreliable without further analysis.


**5) Interpreting Results:**

A hash match is the most reliable indicator.  String matches require further investigation to confirm context and avoid false positives.  Any positive findings should be corroborated by other analysis techniques (e.g., sandbox analysis, static/dynamic malware analysis).


**6) Defensive Mitigations:**

*   **Write-Blocking:** Use write-blocking tools to prevent accidental modification of the target system during analysis.
*   **Virtualization:**  Analyze the suspected system in a virtual machine to contain potential threats.
*   **Sandbox Analysis:** Use a malware sandbox to analyze suspicious files in an isolated environment.
*   **Full System Image:** Create a forensic image of the entire system before any analysis.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Follow a documented incident response plan to handle the situation appropriately.

**Note:** This procedure is a starting point for investigation.  Comprehensive malware analysis requires advanced skills and specialized tools.  Improper handling can damage evidence or further compromise the system.  Consult with a qualified digital forensics expert when necessary.
